This repository contains a set of utilities related to jenkins cli tools
which are required during my day-to-day work at least once per week.

The required setup for these tools to work are:

1. Jenkins master/slave up and running
2. ssh-copy-id run on master for the slaves

Q: Why running the slave from the scripts located in the slave computer?
A: Legacy reasons, please don't ask. Feel Free to fork and change
